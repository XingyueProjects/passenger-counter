# Enemies Defeated Counter

This is a simple web application that allows users to count and save the number of enemies defeated. The application consists of an HTML file, a CSS file for styling, and a JavaScript file for functionality.

## Files

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Click the "INCREMENT" button to increase the count of enemies defeated.
3. Click the "SAVE" button to save the current count. The saved counts will be displayed below the buttons.

## Project Structure

### HTML

The HTML file includes a heading, a counter display, two buttons, and a paragraph to display saved counts.

### CSS

The CSS file styles the body, competition div, headings, and buttons.

### JavaScript
The JavaScript file contains the logic for incrementing and saving the count.
